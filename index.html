		<h1>tModLoader Guide</h1>
		<p>This is a guide for how to mod things into tModLoader. It is an extension to the
			<a href="https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki">tModLoader wiki</a>, which is a good resource,
			but only focuses on general things and doesn't go into more detail about things like weapons.
			Or sometimes <a href="https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/tree/1.4.4/ExampleMod">ExampleMod</a>
			has too many distracting features in an element or doesn't even have something.
			That's what this guide is for!</p>
		<p>If you're new to modding, check out the
			<a href="https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki/Basic-tModLoader-Modding-Guide">getting started guide</a>
			on the tModLoader wiki to learn how to set up your mod.</p>
		<h2>Beginner Guides</h2>
		<p>These guides cover the most basic features that you can mod in. Keep in mind that these require
			basic C# knowledge - you should know what classes are.</p>
